Hi Everyone,

My name is Matthew Stackhouse.  I am currently pursuing a BS in Information Technology with a minor in Data Analytics.
I have been working in manufacturing for over a decade and decided it's time to move into a new career.
I enjoy programming and learning about most things in IT.  I have been also coding on CodeCademy, and have gone through
portions of classes on programming in Coursera.  I have dabbled with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Java, SQL, and Python. 
I am hoping to get some projects and skills under my belt for a career transition in data analytics or software development.
Most of my programming experience I have is with G and M code programming CNC equipment.
